          What is a standrd. In this context standards refer to how browsers should render HTML, CSS
          when you say width="100px" the standard 'recommends' exactly what this should do (More on this on a moment).            
          <br><br>
          Note w3c does not publish strict standards but rather strong recommendations. This is true for HTML & CSS and differs
          from ECMA. Standards for programming languages are much stricter and should be thought of as rules not recommendation.
          <br><br>
          Standards can be in different states candidate and recommendation

          This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty  
          whatsoever. However, it could start a revolution in information access. We are  
          currently using WWW for user support at CERN. We would be very interested in  
          comments from anyone trying WWW, and especially those making other data  
          available, as part of a truly world-wide web. </strong>
        <aside>
          Everyone knows this guy right?
          <br>
          At the very beginning we start to see an approach or philosophy of openess that 
          would later became an inegral part of the web.
          <br><br>
          Note way before this open standards had been succesfull note tcp/ip from 1979
          <br><br>
          Applying the same logic of the standards that connect your computer.
          <br>
          IMPORTANT - this is the philosophy of openess that embodied the development of the web 
          from the very beginning, and as mozilla grows we should be concious {something in here to work on}

          So we have a way of formulating the rules. And the advantages to following the rules
          are what's described in the manifesto. Interoperability - non Proprietary standards.

          But what happens when you do not follow the rules.

        <h2>Let's Talk About Microsoft In The Late 90's and Early 2000's </h2>
        <aside>
          <br>
          In the late nineties IE rapidly overtook netscape in market penetration. 1st browser war saw ms throwing money
          at IE, integrating the browser into their OS and dominating the market.
          <br>
          It was during this time that MS Even though we had an establised method for evolving standards
          ms went there own way.
          <br>
          For developers this was awful. You needed to spend most of your time developing for the browser with the
          largest audience. Remember those "Best Viewed in IE badges.
          <br>
          Developing solely for IEs Proprietary standards broke most of the bullets we previously mentioned
          and would bake in problems later. Even today there are many applications that only work in IE6 because
          that specific version had a Proprietary feature that was coded too.

        <aside>
          IE bundles a ton of Proprietary features, ignores W3c recommendations. 
          <br>
          imagine coding for ie, you have to now code once for ie and again for other browsers following
          w3c recs. what happens when there are even more browsers on the market.. or mobile?

        <aside>
          Someone forgot what the word standard means
          <br>
          Developing cross-browser websites was incredibly painful.
          The promise of write once run everywhere failed. You had to code for ie and everybody else
          Who knows if the features you coded against would exist in the future?
          Supporting multiple versions of IE became even more of a pain.
          Not just IE vs Netscape but IE6 vs IE7 vs IE8 vs Nestscape

          When microsoft innovated - they did it in a way outside of the standards process. And did so privately.
          They used innovation to develop market share not to push the web forward. Remember designed for IE.
          However some of their Proprietary standards eventually were adopted XMLHttpRequest for example.
