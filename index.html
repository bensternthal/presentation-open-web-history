          This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty  
          whatsoever. However, it could start a revolution in information access. We are  
          currently using WWW for user support at CERN. We would be very interested in  
          comments from anyone trying WWW, and especially those making other data  
          available, as part of a truly world-wide web. </strong>

          W3C founded to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and 
          guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.             
          <br>
          Note w3c does not publish strict standards but rather strong recommendations.
          IE rapidly overtook netscape in market penetration. 1st browser war saw ms throwing money
          at IE and dominating the market. Even though we had an establised method for evolving standards
          ms went there own way.

          Someone forgot what the word standars means
          <br>
          Developing cross-browser websites was incredibly painful.
          The promise of write once run everywhere failed. You had to code for ie and everybody else
          Who knows if the features you coded against would exist in the future?
          Supporting multiple versions of IE became even more of a pain.
          Not just IE vs Netscape but IE6 vs IE7 vs IE8 vs Nestscape

          When microsoft innovated - they did it in a way outside of the standards process. And used
          innovation to develop market share not to push the web forward. Remember designed for IE
